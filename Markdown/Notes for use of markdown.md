# Notes for use of markdown

The source for CALM is the markdown documents. All other formats are produced from the original markdown, so edits should not be made to other formats. For practical purposes I make small changes against the mark-down, Word, and HTML - simply because the rendering from Markdown has too many manual steps.

The markdown is broken down into sections, and is rendered in the following order.

1. Title and Verso.md
2. About this book.md
3. Overview of the CALM Models.md
4. Qualify.md
5. Prove.md
6. Workload Model.md
7. Lifecycle Model.md
8. Health Model.md
9. Cost Model.md
10. Security Model.md
11. Availability model.md
12. Data Model.md
13. Capacity model.md
14. Deployment Model.md
15. Integration Model.md
16. Operational model.md
17. Test Model.md
