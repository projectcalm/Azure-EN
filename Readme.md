CALM (Cloud ALM) is guidance for building cloud applications by taking an approach where the entire application lifecycle is considered. It based on a set of models that are produced during the design and implementation of the application. 

The current release specifically addresses considerations with applications to be developed and deployed Windows Azure. CALM is not prescriptive and will apply to any project targeted at Windows Azure.

The project source consists of markdown documents. Any edits should be on this markdown source, rather than other formats.

The download includes pdf, html, mobi, epub and other formats.

A printed version of the book is available for order from [Lulu](http://www.lulu.com/shop/simon-munro/calm-cloud-application-lifecycle-management-with-windows-azure/paperback/product-20545617.html)
